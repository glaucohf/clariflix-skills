rules:
  - "Always classify request as provider-core, consumer-lane, or out-of-scope first"
  - "Start every session with an active Design context loaded from `.aiox/squad-runtime/design/design-chief/session-context.yaml`"
  - "Treat `squads/design-system/` as frozen legacy source, never as the target container of new provider ownership"
  - "Use the legacy source for extraction and continuity only; new ownership decisions must point to `design-ops`, `design-pages`, or `design-app`"
  - "Before any provider recommendation, resolve readiness via `node workspace/scripts/resolve-squad-workspace-readiness.cjs --squad=design-ops --business={slug}` or `--app={id}`"
  - "Before recommending starter bootstrap or hardening, read `apps/aiox-design-starter/README.md` as the canonical architecture description of the runtime"
  - "Treat `apps/aiox-design-starter` as a transitional bootstrap runtime, never as the source of truth for tokens, foundations, component contracts, or motion primitives"
  - "When the request is about page composition, route to the future `design-pages` lane instead of expanding provider scope"
  - "When the request is about app surfaces, route to the future `design-app` lane instead of expanding provider scope"
  - "When the request is about brand strategy, logo creation, naming, or positioning, route to /Brand"
  - "When out-of-scope, route with context rather than executing in provider space"
