## Description

Apply the Critical Eye scoring engine to every variant in the inventory. The engine evaluates 5 dimensions totaling 100 points: Breadth (25), Quality (30), Consistency (20), Maturity (15), Simplicity (10). Includes the absolute blocker: accessibility score = 0 triggers automatic REJECT regardless of total.

## Output Schema
- **produces:** `outputs/design-system/critical-eye/cycle-{N}/scored.json`
- **format:** JSON — each variant with detailed per-dimension scores
- **consumed_by:** ds-critical-eye-compare

## Prerequisites

- Inventory output from `ds-critical-eye-inventory` available
- `squads/design-system/data/critical-eye-scoring-rules.yaml` loaded
- Component source files accessible for quality evaluation
- Component metadata JSONs accessible for enrichment

## Workflow

### Steps

1. **Load Inputs**
   - Read inventory JSON from previous step
   - Read `critical-eye-scoring-rules.yaml` — full scoring configuration
   - Check: both files valid and compatible (same cycle number)

2. **Score Breadth (25 pts) — Nathan Curtis Breadth Scale**
   - For each variant:
     - Count `variant.sources.length`
     - Apply rule: 1 source = 0pts (snowflake), 2 = 10pts (discuss), 3 = 15pts (probable), 4 = 20pts (strong), 5+ = 25pts (confirmed)
   - Check: breadth score assigned to every variant

3. **Score Quality (30 pts) — EightShapes Component QA**
   - For each variant, evaluate 6 sub-dimensions:
     - **token_compliance** (5pts): Count hardcoded values in source files (`#hex`, `Npx` except 0px). 0 hardcoded = 5pts, <5 = 3pts, 5-10 = 1pt, >10 = 0pts
     - **states_coverage** (5pts): Count states implemented vs reference [default, hover, focus, disabled, error, loading]. Prorated: (implemented / 6) * 5
     - **accessibility** (5pts, BLOCKER): Check WCAG AA contrast, ARIA attributes, keyboard nav, focus-visible. Score 0 = AUTOMATIC REJECT
     - **responsiveness** (5pts): Check breakpoints coverage (mobile/tablet/desktop). All 3 = 5pts, 2 = 3pts, 1 = 1pt, fixed = 0pts
     - **composability** (5pts): Evaluate how well it composes with other catalog variants. 3+ canonicals = 5pts, 1-2 = 3pts, requires adaptation = 1pt, incompatible = 0pts
     - **resilience** (5pts): Test edge cases [empty content, long text, overflow, missing image, RTL]. All = 5pts, 3+ = 3pts, 1-2 = 1pt, none = 0pts
   - Sum sub-dimensions for quality total
   - Check: quality.accessibility evaluated — if 0, immediately flag variant for REJECT

4. **Score Consistency (20 pts) — GOV.UK Contribution Criteria**
   - For each variant, evaluate 3 sub-dimensions:
     - **naming** (5pts): Check naming conventions (kebab-case, semantic prefixes). 100% = 5pts, minor desvios = 3pts, inconsistent = 0pts
     - **api_patterns** (5pts): Check CVA + variant pattern + slot pattern usage. Full = 5pts, partial = 3pts, different API = 0pts
     - **visual_harmony** (10pts): Evaluate visual coherence with DS. Indistinguishable = 10pts, small differences = 7pts, recognizably different = 4pts, conflicts = 0pts
   - Check: consistency total calculated for all variants

5. **Score Maturity (15 pts) — USWDS Component Lifecycle**
   - For each variant, evaluate 3 sub-dimensions:
     - **stability** (5pts): Check lifecycleHistory for breaking changes. No changes in 3+ cycles = 5pts, minor in last = 3pts, major recent = 1pt, new = 0pts
     - **documentation** (5pts): Check for guidelines + API + examples + do/dont. Full = 5pts, partial = 3pts, JSDoc only = 1pt, none = 0pts
     - **tests** (5pts): Check for unit + visual regression + a11y tests. All = 5pts, unit only = 3pts, smoke = 1pt, none = 0pts
   - Check: maturity total calculated

6. **Score Simplicity (10 pts) — Brad Frost Death to Complexity**
   - For each variant, evaluate 2 sub-dimensions:
     - **complexity** (5pts): Count LOC of main component file. <50 = 5pts, 50-150 = 3pts, 150-300 = 1pt, >300 = 0pts
     - **dependencies** (5pts): Count external deps (excluding React + CVA). 0 = 5pts, 1-2 = 3pts, 3-5 = 1pt, 6+ = 0pts
   - Check: simplicity total calculated

7. **Calculate Total Score**
   - Sum all 5 dimension totals: breadth + quality + consistency + maturity + simplicity
   - Maximum possible: 25 + 30 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 100
   - Check: total is between 0 and 100 for all variants

8. **Apply Accessibility Blocker**
   - For any variant where `quality.accessibility == 0`:
     - Override lifecycle to `REJECT`
     - Flag with `blocker: "accessibility_zero"`
     - Log: "Variant {id} REJECTED — accessibility score 0 is absolute blocker"
   - Check: all a11y-zero variants flagged

9. **Generate Scored Output**
   - Create `scored.json` with each variant's complete score breakdown
   - Include dimension totals, sub-dimension details, and any blocker flags
   - Check: output valid JSON, all variants scored

10. **Apply AI Fingerprint Block (Cross-fit bench 2026-05-19, override-aware 2026-05-19 RT)**
    Authority: `.claude/rules/design-absolute-bans.md` + artifact contract `ai-fingerprint-report`
    Override: `squads/design-ops/data/ai-fingerprint-allowlist.yaml`

    - For each variant that originated from a URL extract, attempt to read
      `outputs/design-ops/url-extracts/{company}/ai-fingerprint-report.json`
      (the file emitted by `scripts/extract-from-url/run.cjs` via
      `lib/ai-fingerprint-detector.cjs`).

    - If the file exists:
      - Read `ai_slop_score` (0-100) and `recommendation`
      - Read allowlist `squads/design-ops/data/ai-fingerprint-allowlist.yaml`
      - **Check overrides in priority order (1→3):**
        1. `allowlist_by_brief_id` — match `variant.brief_id`
        2. `allowlist_by_intentional_aesthetic` — match `variant.briefing.intentional_aesthetic`
        3. `allowlist_by_domain` — match URL host (strip `www.`)
      - Append `ai_fingerprint` block:
        ```json
        {
          "ai_slop_score": 73,
          "recommendation": "rebrief-recommended",
          "hits_by_severity": { "P0": 1, "P1": 4, "P2": 2 },
          "override_applied": "allowlist_by_intentional_aesthetic:brutalism",
          "downgrade_to": "concern"
        }
        ```
      - **Gate decision:**
        - If override matched → set `variant.verdict = "CONCERN_AI_SLOP_OVERRIDDEN"`,
          append observation: `"AI fingerprint score {N}/100 — override: {reason}"`,
          emit audit entry to `outputs/design-ops/audit/ai-fingerprint-overrides.jsonl`.
        - If NO override AND `ai_slop_score > 60` → **HARD GATE**: set
          `variant.verdict = "REJECT_AI_SLOP"`, append blocker reason
          `"AI fingerprint score {N}/100 — rebrief required (no override in allowlist)"`.
          This is the absolute blocker alongside accessibility=0.
        - If `21 <= ai_slop_score <= 60` → append non-blocking warning to notes.
        - If `ai_slop_score <= 20` → silent pass.

    - If the file does NOT exist:
      - The variant was not extracted via /design-md. Skip silently. Do not flag as gap.

    - **Audit log emission (mandatory when override applied):**
      Append JSONL line to `outputs/design-ops/audit/ai-fingerprint-overrides.jsonl`:
      ```json
      {"timestamp":"2026-05-19T...","variant_id":"...","ai_slop_score":73,"override_source":"allowlist_by_intentional_aesthetic","override_value":"brutalism","approver":"@founder","brief_id":"..."}
      ```

    - Check: every URL-extracted variant either has `ai_fingerprint` block,
      `ai_fingerprint_override` block, or explicit "no_fingerprint_report" note.

## Failure Handling

- **Inventory not found:** Abort with "Run ds-critical-eye-inventory first."
- **Source files missing:** Score quality dimensions as 0 with note "source files not found"
- **Scoring rules invalid:** Abort with YAML parsing error details

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 5 dimensions scored for every variant
- [ ] Breadth based on actual source counts
- [ ] Quality evaluated against real component source code
- [ ] Accessibility blocker applied (score=0 → REJECT)
- [ ] Total scores between 0-100
- [ ] Scored JSON output complete and valid
- [ ] No dimension left as null after evaluation
