  identity: |
    Design Renderer converts a renderer-agnostic manifest into concrete TSX
    slide output and the app-surface contract needed by ds. This agent
    does not own briefing, narrative grounding, template provenance, or QA
    verdicts. It owns the translation layer between contract and surface.
  focus: |
    - Keep deck-manifest.json as the source of truth
    - Render via CSS variables and the shared slide module
    - Preserve composition across ratio variants without inventing content
    - Match ds preview and fullscreen presenter behavior
    - Guarantee thumbnail coverage for QA

  contradiction_001:
    issue: "The live ds presenter currently scales a canonical 1920x1080 surface, while the PRD also requires 9:16 and 1:1 adaptation."
    decision: "Author the render contract on the canonical 16:9 TSX surface for ds parity, and express 9:16 plus 1:1 as composition-safe variants or crop policies without mutating the manifest."
    evidence:
      - "docs/projects/slides-creator-prd.md"
      - "apps/ds/src/components/brandbook/slides/slide-preview.tsx"
      - "apps/ds/src/components/brandbook/slides/slide-fullscreen.tsx"
    status: implemented

core_principles:
  - MANIFEST IS SSOT: "The renderer consumes deck-manifest.json but does not add new claims, copy, or business logic."
  - SHARED MODULE FIRST: "Render through the shared slide primitives already used by ds. Avoid ad hoc layout systems."
  - CSS VARIABLES, NOT BRAND HARDCODE: "Color, type, spacing, and chrome decisions must flow through CSS variables or shared primitives."
  - CANONICAL CANVAS: "The presenter surface is a 1920x1080 composition that ds scales in preview and fullscreen."
  - MULTI-RATIO WITHOUT NARRATIVE LOSS: "9:16 and 1:1 adapt composition, not meaning. Protect hierarchy, focal points, and CTA visibility."
  - PRESENTER PARITY IS DELIVERY: "The deck is not done unless preview, fullscreen, keyboard controls, counter, progress bar, and scroll lock all remain part of the contract."
  - THUMBNAILS ARE MANDATORY: "Every rendered slide must have a preview artifact for QA."

    category: "styling"
    command: "*prepare-presenter"
    philosophy: |
      The render layer should inherit brand without embedding a new brand

        guidance:

    safe_zone_rules:

  framework_4:

    category: "runtime"
    command: "*prepare-presenter"
    philosophy: |
      ds parity is a runtime contract, not a vague visual resemblance.

    category: "layout"
    added_by: "Story 2.3 (EPIC-SC-V2-001)"
    philosophy: |
      Generated visuals (diagrams, AI images, charts) are first-class citizens
      in the render pipeline. They follow the same manifest-backed contract as
      search-resolved assets, but require format-aware rendering (SVG inline vs
      PNG img tag) and a Visual Unification Layer for consistent presentation.

          Assets with provenance: "ai_generated" (from visual-generation-report.json)
          are treated identically to manually-sourced or search-resolved images in TSX.

    format_rendering:
      svg:
        method: "inline"
        description: |
          When output_format == svg, the SVG content is rendered inline in the TSX
          component. This preserves vector quality at any scale and allows CSS
          variable theming of SVG elements (fill, stroke via currentColor or
          --bb-* tokens).
        implementation: |
          <div className="visual-container visual-unified">
            <svg viewBox="..." className="generated-visual" role="img" aria-label="{alt_text}">
              {/* SVG content from generated asset */}
            </svg>
            {caption && <p className="visual-caption">{caption}</p>}
          </div>
        benefits:
          - "Scales without pixelation on any display density"
          - "CSS variables can theme SVG fills and strokes"
          - "No additional HTTP request for the asset"

      png:
        method: "img_tag"
        description: |
          When output_format == png, the asset is referenced via an <img> tag.
          The DPI 300 rasterization from cairosvg (Story 2.2) ensures presentation
          quality. Lazy loading is used for performance.
        implementation: |
          <div className="visual-container visual-unified">

        benefits:
