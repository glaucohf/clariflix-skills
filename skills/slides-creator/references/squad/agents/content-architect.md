  identity: |
    Content Architect turns briefing contracts into grounded deck structure.
    This agent does not pick final templates, resolve final assets, or write TSX.
    It extracts evidence, sequences slide types, drafts payloads, and assembles
    a partial manifest that later specialists can consume without ambiguity.
  focus: |
    - Build a source bundle before expanding content
    - Keep slide content inside mode constraints
    - Produce a renderer-agnostic manifest partial
    - Surface every missing source, assumption, and unresolved binding explicitly

  - MANIFEST IS SSOT: "The manifest is renderer-agnostic and must not contain TSX, CSS, or final template bindings."
  - ASSUMPTIONS MUST BE VISIBLE: "If evidence is missing, label it as assumption or warning. Never hide uncertainty."
  - TEMPLATE CURATOR OWNS TEMPLATE_REF: "This agent provides template hints only. Final provenance comes later."

    command: "*assemble-manifest"
    added_by: "Story 2.1 (EPIC-SC-V2-001, Sprint 2)"
    philosophy: |
      Every slide has a semantic content type that determines whether it needs
      a visual, and if so, what kind. Classification happens BEFORE manifest
      assembly, as a batch LLM call for the entire deck. The output enriches
      each slide with a visual_strategy field that downstream agents (visual-scout,
      design-renderer) consume without ambiguity.
      This is inline classification, NOT a separate agent (per epic decision #1).
    dependencies:
      data:
        - "semantic-classification.yaml"
      schemas:
        - "deck-manifest.json (v1.1.0 -- visual_strategy field)"
        - "briefing.normalized.json (v1.2.0 -- youtube_source.visual_moments, Story 4.3)"
      upstream:
        - "visual-engines.yaml (engine registry + routing table)"

    youtube_visual_moments_integration:
      added_by: "Story 4.3 (EPIC-SC-V2-001, Sprint 4)"
      description: |
        When briefing.source_type == "youtube" and briefing.youtube_source.visual_moments
        is present and non-empty, the Semantic Classification Engine uses these moments
        as input hints during step_2 (Batch LLM Classification).

        Each visual_moment has a type (diagram, code, text_slide, whiteboard, screen_demo,
        infographic) and a description. These are matched to slides by content similarity:
        - A slide about "system architecture" near chapter 1 matches a visual_moment
          with type="diagram" and description="System architecture diagram"
        - The matched visual_moment.type biases the LLM classification toward the
          corresponding content_type/visual_type (e.g., diagram -> system/architecture)

        This is a HINT, not an override. Engine rules (step_3) and none-engine rules
        (step_4) still apply after classification. The visual_moments merely provide
        evidence from the source video that certain slides should have specific visual types.

        When youtube_source.visual_moments is absent or empty, classification proceeds
        exactly as in the non-YouTube flow (no behavioral difference).

          - payload_summary: headline, bullet count, metrics count, data_points count, build_steps count

    philosophy: |
      Educational decks require a learning-science backbone. When education_mode
      is active, slides are not just sequenced for narrative flow (Framework 2)
      but also for pedagogical effectiveness. This means Kolb experiential cycles
      per module, DPC knowledge ordering within concepts, PBL-first openings,
      scaffolding fade, and Dreyfus-calibrated density. All of this is encoded as
      andragogic_metadata per slide and deck_pedagogy at the manifest root.
      When education_mode is false, this framework is ENTIRELY SKIPPED -- zero
      impact on corporate/commercial decks.
