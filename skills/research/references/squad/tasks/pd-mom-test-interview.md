## Metadata

```yaml

description: "Conducts ≥10 Mom Test behavioral interviews extracting past behavior (not future intent) and synthesizes behavioral patterns."
```

## Why klein

Tier 1 NDM (Naturalistic Decision Making) specialist. Mom Test methodology *is* behavioral pattern extraction under uncertainty — klein's specialty. Pre-mortem / sensemaking framing maps directly to interview-derived insight synthesis.

## Steps

1. **Read source framework:** `squads/research/data/product-discovery-framework.md` § Protocol 2 — Mom Test Interviews
2. **Generate interview guide (15min):**
   - Opening (2min): neutral context-setting, NO mention of the idea
   - Behavioral core (10min): 8-10 questions in past-tense format ("Tell me about the last time…", "Show me how you solved…", "How much did you spend on…")
   - Depth probes (3min): "And then what?" / "Why that specific way?" / "How much time/money?"
3. **Apply anti-bias filters:** validate that ALL questions follow Mom Test laws (talk about their life, past-specific, listen more). Reject any "would you" / "do you think" / "is it useful?" formulation.
4. **Provide handling scripts:** how to redirect when interviewees suggest features, when they offer empty praise, when they speak in hypotheticals.
5. **Generate per-interview notes template:** Observed behaviors / Quantified pains / Current hacks / Unexpected insights / Open follow-up questions.
6. **Conduct or accept interview transcripts:** user pastes interview notes; agent supports synchronous coaching during real interviews if `--coaching` flag set.
7. **Synthesize behavioral patterns:** identify recurring behaviors, quantified pains, current hacks. Use klein's NDM pattern-matching.
8. **Generate red-flag report:** vague answers, hypothetical focus, excessive politeness, lack of concrete examples → flagged interviews are excluded from pattern synthesis.
9. **Compute GO/NO-GO:** apply threshold rule (≥10 interviews + ≥5 insights + ≥3 corroborated specific pains).
10. **Persist:** write `02-mom-test.md` with all evidence, synthesis, and verdict.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Interview guide passes Mom Test law audit (zero forbidden questions)
- ≥10 interviews conducted (real users or explicitly flagged simulated)
- Behavioral pattern synthesis produces ≥5 insights
- ≥3 quantified specific pains corroborated across ≥3 interviews
- Red-flag report distinguishes signal from noise
- `02-mom-test.md` persisted with verdict

## GO/NO-GO Threshold

| Result | Verdict |
|---|---|
| <10 interviews completed | NEEDS-REWORK — insufficient sample |
| ≥10 + <5 insights | NEEDS-REWORK — interview quality issue, redo with stricter Mom Test discipline |
| ≥10 + ≥5 insights + <3 corroborated pains | NO-GO — problem not validated as widespread/sharp |
| ≥10 + ≥5 insights + ≥3 corroborated pains | GO — proceed to Villain Mapping atom |
