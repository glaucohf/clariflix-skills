# Task: Create From SOP -- Map + Workflow

**Task ID:** create-from-sop-map-workflow
**Parent Task:** `create-from-sop.md`
**Purpose:** Extract processes from classified sources, synthesize workflows, surface gaps
**Execution Type:** Agent
**Model:** `Opus`
**Haiku Eligible:** NO

## Task Anatomy

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **task_name** | Create From SOP -- Map + Workflow |
| **status** | `active` |
| **responsible_executor** | @pedro-valerio |
| **execution_type** | Agent |
| **input** | `source_classification` YAML from load-classify step |
| **output** | Task inventory + workflow map + open questions |
| **action_items** | 3 steps |
| **acceptance_criteria** | Processes mapped, workflows synthesized, gaps surfaced |

---

## Workflow

### Step 2: Process Mapping

For each `executable_process`, extract:

```yaml
mapped_process:
  source_path: string
  task_name: string
  executor: Human | Agent | Hybrid | Worker
  inputs: []
  outputs: []
  checkpoints: []
  guardrails: []
  dependencies: []
```

**Rules:**

- Do not transform context into operational step without evidence in the YAML
- Do not merge different processes just because they live in the same namespace
- Do not lose ownership; each output needs an owner or guardian

### Step 3: Workflow Synthesis

1. Group processes by phase
2. Draw unidirectional flow
3. Declare mandatory checkpoints
4. Convert metadata/status signals into guardrails or quality gates

### Step 4: Gap Surface

Generate `open_questions` whenever:

- A process depends on information that does not exist in any selected YAML
- There is ambiguity of owner/responsible
- The YAML describes state but not action
- There is conflict between selected sources

**Mandatory notation:** mark as `[MISSING]`, `[AMBIGUOUS]`, or `[CONFLICT]`.

## Output Contract

```yaml
process_mapping:
  task_inventory:
    - task_name: "{name}"
      source_path: "{path}"
      executor: "Human|Agent|Hybrid|Worker"
      inputs: []
      outputs: []
      checkpoints: []
      guardrails: []
      dependencies: []

  workflow_map:
    phases:
      - phase_id: "{id}"
        name: "{name}"
        tasks: []
        checkpoint: "{criteria}"
        handoff: "{to whom}"

  open_questions:
    - type: "MISSING|AMBIGUOUS|CONFLICT"
      description: "{what is unclear}"
      source: "{which YAML}"
      impact: "{what it blocks}"
```
