# React Rules Knowledge Base

Granular React best-practice rules absorbed from v0 vercel-agent-skills.
Each rule file is a standalone .md with frontmatter (title, impact, tags) and
Incorrect/Correct code examples.

These rules feed the rule-compiler pipeline and are queryable by brad-frost
and page-composer agents for pattern enforcement.
