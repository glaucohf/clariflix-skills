# Generate Audit Report

## Purpose

Consolidate all findings from a passive security audit into a structured report with executive summary, detailed findings, compliance mapping, and remediation roadmap.

## Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary** — Score, finding count, PII impact
2. **Scope** — App, stack, methodology (passive only)
3. **Findings Table** — ID, title, severity, CVSS, OWASP, NIST
4. **Finding Details** — Description, evidence, impact, fix
5. **Compliance** — LGPD/OWASP/NIST mapping
6. **Remediation Roadmap** — Phased plan with effort estimates
7. **Conclusion** — Overall assessment and next steps

## Severity Scoring

Overall app score = highest active CVSS finding, adjusted by:
- Number of CRITICAL findings
- PII exposure scope
- Active breach status

## Constraints

- Report MUST be in PT-BR with proper accents
- Report MUST follow SAIOS template format
- Every finding MUST include remediation steps
- NEVER include intrusive test results (this is passive-only)
