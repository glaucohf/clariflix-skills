# Spy Squad — Architecture

## Overview

O squad `spy` combina **competitive intelligence** + **evidence-based research**: universal benchmarking, content analysis, PICO/OSINT pipeline, systematic reviews, decision science, e bias detection. Absorveu o squad legado `deep-research` em 2026-04-13.

       ↓
bench-analyst designs benchmark methodology
       ↓

Matrix + gap analysis + battle card
```

## Evidence Hierarchy (Sackett)

```
Level 1: Systematic reviews + meta-analyses
Level 2: RCTs (randomized controlled trials)
Level 3: Cohort studies
Level 4: Case-control studies
Level 5: Expert opinion (lowest)
```

Spy always prioritizes Level 1-2 sources; Level 5 tagged as such.

## Bias Mitigation (Kahneman + Higgins + Ioannidis)

| Bias | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Confirmation bias | Pre-register hypothesis before collecting data |
| Availability heuristic | Systematic search (booth) vs. ad-hoc |
| Anchoring | Multiple independent estimates |
| Publication bias | Check Level 1 meta-analyses, not just studies |
| False positives | Ioannidis p-value correction, replication check |

## Outputs Location

| Type | Path |
|------|------|
| Research reports | `outputs/spy/{case-slug}/` |
| Swipe files (content DNA) | `outputs/spy/swipes/{competitor-slug}/` |
| Battle cards (benchmarks) | `outputs/spy/benchmarks/{comparison-id}/` |
| Systematic reviews | `outputs/spy/reviews/{topic}/` |

## Integration Points

| Consumer | Uses spy outputs for |
|----------|---------------------|
| brand-chief | Competitive positioning |
| hormozi-chief | Market analysis before offer design |
| c-level (vision-chief) | Strategic decision support |
| copy-chief | Swipe files → copy frameworks |

## Boundary

- **In scope:** Research (deep, market, tech), competitive intelligence, benchmarking, evidence-based analysis, bias detection, decision support
- **Out of scope:** Creative execution (@copy, @brand), strategic decision making (@c-level consumes spy outputs), product strategy (@hormozi consumes spy outputs)

## Tasks Canônicas (59 total)

Extensive library covering: deep research templates, PICO question formulation, systematic review protocols, benchmark methodologies, competitor clone procedures, swipe file generators, evidence hierarchy checklists, bias assessment frameworks, DORA metric collection, OSINT techniques.
